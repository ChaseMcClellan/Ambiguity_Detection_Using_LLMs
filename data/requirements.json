One step in the automated process is to install the temboard agent in a newly installed PostgreSQL server. Then this agent automatically contact the temboard server to register all PostgreSQL instances and databases found on the newly installed PostgreSQL server.\r\n\r\nWhat we also really like with temboard is that temboard users don't have to recreate connections to the PostgreSQL servers they have to manage: it's done once for all users.\r\nSo to reproduce this in omnidb seem currently not possible.\r\nOne suggestion could be to implement groups in omnidb. Then associate users and PostgreSQL connections to groups: by the way, all users in a group could automatically get access to all PostgreSQL connections assigned to that group.\r\nThis last feature request would be particularly important and urgent to continue considering omnidb for an enterprise usage, when you have teams of several tens of DBAs.",

Only if the column is very wide (for example a huge JSON column) should it be cut off.\r\n  - For the columns that are cut off, double clicking the column width expander should auto fit that column\r\n- Auto fit the width of the navigator window on the left and always keep it auto fit. So if you collapse some nodes causing it to need less width then it shrinks, and same when expanding some nodes it should expand to the width it needs\r\n- The table details window on the bottom left of the screen should be able to be closed in settings. For the kind of information I need when I'm in the GUI it isn't something I ever look at so it takes up useful screen real estate from the navigator window\r\n- Closing a tab shouldn't require a confirmation, at least this should be configurable in settings. We are used to closing tabs without confirmation in browsers, text editors, IDEs, and this should be no different. The only case is if you have unsaved changes then it should prompt if we'd like to save changes\r\n- A less intrusive close icon should be used, for example the way browsers do it where the close icon appears only when you mouse over the tab. Because right now I have many distracting bright red \"X\" icons all over the screen\r\n- Be able to customize the font used in the application. I have some nice system fonts that I use in my IDE and other applications and it would be good to be able to use the same one in this application, which is also nice when all applications I use have a consistent font\r\n- Don't make all text in the navigator on the left in a bold font, because when everything is bold then nothing stands out in the navigator window and it's harder on the eyes",

That was quite helpful when dealing with different DB instances all of which have almost the same structure. You quickly get lost in there. Background colors were really nice here.\r\nI hope this wouldn't be too difficult to implement.",
